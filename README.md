This is my repository for project 3 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree, which contains the files for two apps. See below for screenshots. The goal of this project was to improve the two apps based on user reviews and suggestions.
Features implemented include: barcode scanning functionality, network error handling, information and collection widgets, and support for layout mirroring as well as accessibility.
