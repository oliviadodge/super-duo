This is my repository for project 3 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree, which includes the files for two apps. The goal of this project was to improve two apps based on user reviews and suggestions.
Features implemented include: barcode scanning functionality, network error handling, information and collection widgets, and support for layout mirroring as well as accessibility.
